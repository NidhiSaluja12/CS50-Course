In programming, basically we learn command line programing only, textual format.

In web programming , we learn graphical format.

Web programming technologies include: HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascaded Style Sheet), Java Script, Node js etc

What is Internet?
Network of network. Internet is an infrastructure on which all the web applications run.

All the systems in the world are interconnected(that's why we can communicate), all the systems are of different types but they all are working on a common thing called CPU which contains RAM, ROM, hard disks etc.

Routers:
During communications, data has to be tranferred from one system to another and there are more than one path between two systems so the device which directs the data packets is called a Router.

Protocols:
Set of conventions.

Example , if one person extends a hand towards another for handshake then another would also be doing the same as extending the hand towards someone is a sign of hand shaking. So it is Protocol.
So in language of computer science, every computer has different protocols obviously in the form of 0s and 1s , every computer has a different sets of 0s and 1s so it is their protocols(conventions).

Two most common protocols used to get data from one point to another is  TCP(Transmission Control Protocol), IP(Internet Protocol).

- IP Address : When any computer sends packet from itself to another server , it writes an address of remote server(server it is sending data to) on the packet which is called IP Address. Every system has its own IP Address.

                        Source(packet) ---> Nearest Router ---> Destination

DNS : Domain Name system-> It is a technology that your phone, mac, system support , when human types in one of the human readable languages, DNS converts those names into the IP Addresses.


- TCP : TCP is a solution for many problems and one of those is -> server can support multiple applications at a time like gmail, facebook, video conferencing etc. When the data packet comes it would be difficult for it to find out on which server it was intended to sent to so there is a specific number added to every packet along with IP Address and that number is called Port Number which is useful for the packet to analyse where it should go to. Every application has its specific port number.
        TCP also handles delivery i.e is ensures that when you send data from one point to another and it gets lost so TCP is facilitates the retransmission of data.


Web Server:
when client sends a request to the web server for example sends request for a picture of cat, the packet of request can take any path to reach the web server, now the web server will first read the request and then gives the picture of cat in its own envelope , lets suppose the picture of cat is too big to fit into the packet then the web server will cut the picture,put it in the envelope and then sends it to the client with IP Address, port number and the serial of the fragmented packets written on it. So that clint can get the packet in a proper way.

Summary : Client requests the web server , web server responds to client's request priortising the conditions of packet along with IP Address, Port number, and serial number written on it.

HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) : appears in the beginning of URL; HTTP governs what is inside the envelope while TCP/IP governs what is outside the envelope.
HTTP supports two words: get, post

URL : Uniform Resource Locator  (https://www.example.com)

https: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secured
https denotes that the content of the packet is encrypted.
Get/Http/1.1 (1.1 is the version of Http; 1.1 is most common and in addition to 1.2 , 1.3 also there)
Host: www.example.com

https://www.example.com/index.html : index.html is a file name.

What is icognito mode?

Incognito mode is private browsing that doesn't leave as many tracks. It can erase temporary data that is captured by the PC or device you're using. Deleting cookies — information saved on your web browser — is a great first step toward maintaining your privacy.


You can see the development process of any website by using following process:

    Open website in chrome --> View --> Developer --> Developement tool 


curl :- Its only purpose is to connet with the URL
    - it just only show the http command line

                                            HTML


HTML is not a programming language(no loops, no variables etc), it is a markup language.

Basic HTML Program:


<!DOCTYPE html>  // Document type declaration

<html lang="en"> // open tag/ start tag ; lang = "en" -> attribute en - english
    <head> // open heading tag
        <title> // open title tag
            hello, title 
        </title> // close title tag

    </head> // close heading tag
    <body>  // open body tag
        hello, body 
    </body>  // close body tag
</html> // close tag/ end tag
    

* phishing
* #- unique identifier
* . - class centered
